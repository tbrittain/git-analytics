## Project Overview

Git Analytics is a desktop application that provides insights and visualizations for Git repositories. It allows users to analyze commit history, contributor activity, and code changes through an intuitive interface.

## Architecture

- **Framework:** Wails v2 (Go backend + Vue 3/TypeScript frontend)
  - **Backend:** Go 1.25 (`main.go`, `app.go`)
- **Frontend:** Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite (`frontend/src/`)

Primary dependencies for core functionality:
- `go-git` for Git repository analysis (`github.com/go-git/go-git/v6`)
- `modernc.org/sqlite` for data layer
- `wailsjs` for frontend-backend communication (auto-generated by Wails)

## Development

```sh
wails dev      # Run in dev mode with hot reload
wails build    # Build for current platform
```

Frontend dependencies:
```sh
cd frontend && npm install
```

## Project Structure

```
app.go                  # Go backend logic (bound to frontend via Wails)
main.go                 # Wails app entry point, window config
frontend/src/
  App.vue               # Root Vue component
  components/           # Vue components
  assets/               # Fonts, images
frontend/wailsjs/       # Auto-generated Wails JS bindings
build/                  # Platform-specific build assets
```

## Design Goals

1. Code should be simple and designed for testability. Add tests for critical logic, especially around Git repository analysis and data handling. Use Go's built-in testing framework and aim for good coverage on core functions.
2. Modular design - core logic should be standalone and not often to change if we want to swap out anything at the "boundary" (e.g. Git library, database, frontend framework).
