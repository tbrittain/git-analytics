# Git Analytics

## About

Git Analytics is a desktop application that provides insights and visualizations for Git repositories.

## Prerequisites
- Go 1.25
- Node 24
- Wails 2.x

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.
